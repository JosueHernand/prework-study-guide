# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation on creating this project was being able to learn on how a website is created since I always like learning new things. I built this project so when I progress further into the course I can always look back into the notes I added into the website whenever I get stuck or forget any codes. Throughout building the website I was able to learn how to use HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
